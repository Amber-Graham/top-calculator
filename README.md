# top-calculator

This is my final foundations project for
The Odin Project! I feel pretty hopeful 
about this project, mainly because we just
went over utilizing array methods in JS. 

I will update this with my final thoughts on
the project and any important information I 
want/need to look back on. :)

final thoughts: 
I really enjoy working with HTML and CSS. I 
loved getting to make the calculator look exactly 
like I wanted! I think front end design is definitely
my bread and butter. For the JS portion, I was 
blown away by switch statements. It cleaned up
the code so well. I thought I was going to have to 
add a lot of comments in there, but the switch statements
were so straight forward and made it easy to read!

Overall, I feel really happy with my progress.

I think it would be fun to make a TI-84 calculator
like I had in school. I think I could definitely
add more functionality to the calculator if I want/need to.
